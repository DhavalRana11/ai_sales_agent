This was an excellent first class to jump into the world of data science.  All of the explanations were clear, and you can tell the instructor truly cares about software education.   It covers all the most important topics in machine learning, and gives just enough theoretical knowledge to have some basic understanding of the algorithms behind the scenes.  I'm already using some of the knowledge learned (and practiced!) here at work.Show moreShow lessInstructorsJose PortillaHead of Data Science at Pierian Training4.6 Instructor Rating1,218,730 Reviews4,052,352 Students87 CoursesJose Marcial Portilla has a BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering from Santa Clara University and years of experience as a professional instructor and trainer for Data Science, Machine Learning and Python Programming.
